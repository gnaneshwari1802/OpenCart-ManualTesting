# Manual Testing Project

## Project Introduction

### **Functionality Understanding & Exploration**
- **FRS (Functional Requirement Specification)**: Understanding the project's functional aspects, such as eCommerce features like login, product search, cart addition, payment, and delivery.
- **Effort Estimation**: Estimating the time and resources required for testing.
- **Test Plan Writing**: Defining test objectives, scope, resources, and scheduling.
- **Test Scenarios & Test Cases**: Writing detailed test scenarios and test cases to cover different functionalities.
- **Environment Setup & Build Deployment**: Setting up the required environment, such as MySQL database, Apache server (XAMPP), etc.

### **Test Execution & Bug Reporting**
- **Test Execution**: Performing tests and logging results.
- **Bug Reporting & Tracking**: Identifying bugs and tracking them using tools like Jira.
- **Sanity Testing, Re-Testing, and Regression Testing**: Verifying bug fixes, ensuring new code doesnâ€™t break existing functionality, and performing sanity checks.
- **Test Sign-off**: Concluding the testing process after meeting the required quality standards.

### **Project vs Product**
- **Project**: The specific effort to develop a solution (e.g., an eCommerce app).
- **Product**: The end result (e.g., the eCommerce platform itself).

---

## Tools & Technology

- **Frontend**: OpenCart frontend URL (`http://localhost/opencart/upload/`), using MySQL and Apache (XAMPP).
- **Backend**: Admin panel and management through an intranet application.
- **Bug Reporting Tools**: Jira (with Zephyr plugin for test management).

---

## Agile Testing & Jira Tool

### **Agile Testing**
- **Iterative and Incremental Approach**: Agile allows for faster release cycles and accepts changes even after development has started.
- **Scrum Methodology**: Using Scrum in Agile, which includes various roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development, and QA teams.
- **Scrum Activities**: Planning sprints, conducting scrum meetings (daily stand-ups), and reviewing sprints at the end of each cycle.

### **Jira Tool Integration**
- **Jira Setup**: Installing and configuring Jira for agile project management.
- **Epic/User Stories**: Creating epics and user stories to define the work.
- **Backlogs**: Managing the product backlog and sprint backlog to prioritize tasks.
- **Sprint Management**: Creating sprints, assigning stories, and managing their lifecycle.
- **Test Management with Zephyr**: Writing and executing test cases, managing test cycles, and generating reports.

### **Burndown Chart & Story Points**
- **Story Points**: Estimating the effort for each story, usually using the Fibonacci series (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
- **Burndown Chart**: Tracking the progress of work remaining in a sprint.

---

## Testing Activities in Jira & Zephyr Plugin

1. **Jira Test Management**: 
   - **Creating Test Cases**: Manually writing test cases and importing them into Jira.
   - **Executing Test Cases**: Running test cases and updating their status (Pass/Fail/Blocked).
   - **Test Cycles**: Adding test cases to cycles and running them in Jira.
   - **Reporting & Traceability Matrix**: Generating reports and ensuring traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects.

2. **Bug Tracking**:
   - **Bug Logging in Jira**: Creating, tracking, and resolving bugs as they are identified during testing.

---

## Key Agile Terminology

- **User Story**: Represents a feature or module in the software.
- **Epic**: A larger body of work, made up of several user stories.
- **Sprint**: A time-boxed period to complete a set of user stories.
- **Scrum Meeting**: Daily stand-ups to discuss progress.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to reflect on the sprint and improve the process.
- **Story Points**: Rough estimation of the effort for a user story.
- **Burndown Chart**: A visual representation of remaining work in a sprint.
